        Analyze kicking movements based on the distance between pelvis and ankle markers.

        This function identifies kicking cycles (from peak to peak), and extracts for each cycle:
        - Amplitude
        - Duration
        - Steepness of extension
        - Mean flexion speed (based on point-wise gradient)
        - Mean extension speed (based on point-wise gradient)

        Parameters:
            pelvis_marker:
            ankle_marker:
            time_duration: time vector (in seconds)
            leg_length:  subject-specific leg length for normalization
